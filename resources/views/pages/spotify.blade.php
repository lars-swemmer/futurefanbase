                  You want everyone to hear your new music, right? On Spotify, the key to getting your releases in front of fans, is to make sure they follow your profile and playlists! Fans who follow will see your new music in their Release Radar, the Spotify app and in the Spotify mail outs. Future Fanbase has a unique feature where we can promote your profile and playlists at the same time, while generating data!

                           Future Fanbase has a unique strategy for artists to collect data while they increase following on Spotify! How? We will create a special, artist branded, webpage connected with the Spotify database to promote your profile and playlists. With this page we can generate data for you, while collecting future fans!

	                            With the right set of promotion tools (like social media marketing, in-house Spotify ads) we are able to increase following on Spotify. With the unique webpage, people are more likely to follow you because of the special artist branding and call to action. Thereby, future fans are just one click away to become your fan on both your profile and playlists. And, within that one click, we will generate the desired data.

You can get information about: age, country, e-mail, follower status, which tracks they like and listen to, which others artists they follow, which other playlists the fan is following etcetera. With the collected data we can make up fan profiles, create lookalike audiences or retarget them in other campaigns.
